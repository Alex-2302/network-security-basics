# Reflection and Security Best Practices

This task provided hands-on experience with basic network security concepts and defensive
controls.

## Lessons Learned
- Firewalls are essential for controlling network access
- Encryption protects data confidentiality
- Network monitoring helps detect unusual activity

## Additional Measures for Larger Networks
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Network segmentation using VLANs
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Centralized logging and SIEM solutions

## Educating Others
To educate others about network security, I would focus on practical examples such as
strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, using secure Wi-Fi, and keeping systems
updated. Relating security concepts to everyday scenarios helps improve awareness and
adoption.
