# Network Security Threats

## Viruses
Viruses are malicious programs that attach themselves to legitimate files or software.
They require user interaction to spread and can cause data corruption, system crashes,
or unauthorized access.

## Worms
Worms are self-replicating malware that spread automatically across networks by exploiting
vulnerabilities. They can consume network bandwidth and degrade system performance.

## Trojans
Trojans are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. Once installed, they
can provide attackers with unauthorized access or allow data theft.

## Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks use social engineering techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive
information such as passwords or financial details. These attacks are commonly delivered
via emails, fake websites, or messages.
