# Task Overview

The objective of this task is to introduce fundamental network security concepts and
practical defensive techniques. The task focuses on understanding common network threats,
configuring basic security controls, monitoring network traffic, and reflecting on
security best practices.

A small virtual network was created to safely experiment with firewall configurations
and traffic analysis without affecting the host operating system or real-world networks.

This task emphasizes defensive security rather than offensive or penetration testing
techniques.
