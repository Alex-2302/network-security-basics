# Introduction to Network Security Basics

This repository documents Task 1 of my internship project, focused on understanding
basic network security concepts, implementing fundamental security measures,
monitoring network traffic, and reflecting on security best practices.

## Objectives
- Understand common network threats such as viruses, worms, trojans, and phishing
- Configure basic security mechanisms like firewalls and encryption
- Monitor and analyze network traffic using Wireshark
- Document findings and reflect on security best practices

## Lab Environment
- Host OS: Linux Mint
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Virtual Machines:
  - Windows 11 (Windows Defender Firewall, Wireshark)
  - Kali Linux (traffic generation only)
- Network Mode:
  - Internal Network (isolated VM-to-VM)
  - NAT Network (temporary, for DNS/HTTP/HTTPS analysis)
- Network Security:
  - WPA2/WPA3-secured mobile hotspot

## Tools Used
- Windows Defender Firewall
- Wireshark
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux

## Key Outcomes
- Implemented default-deny firewall policies
- Created advanced firewall rules (ICMP allow/block)
- Captured and analyzed ICMP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic
- Demonstrated isolated network security concepts
